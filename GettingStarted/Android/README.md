# Getting Started sample for Android

This sample code accompanies the tutorial @ http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-engagement-android-get-started/ and is a finished sample code. 

You need to configure the app code at two places:
1) AndroidManifest.xaml file - Enter the Google project number. 
2) MainActivity.java - configure your Azure Mobile Engagement connection string

## IMPORTANT - Make sure to use the latest Android SDK as the one in the folder here has been deprecated.
